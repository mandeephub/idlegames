If you do not want your contacts stored, you can follow the instructions available at the &ldquo;Learn More&rdquo; link. Passwords provided to us for the purpose of accessing your address book will not be stored.</p>
              <p class="highlight m-0"><b>INFORMATION WE RECEIVE OR COLLECT WHEN YOU ACCESS Funcell GAMES ON A MOBILE DEVICE</b></p>
              <p>We may collect mobile device identifiers, including MAC Address and IP Address when you play our games on your mobile phone or any other mobile device, including iPads and tablets. In certain games, We will create and assign to your device an identifier that is similar to the account number.

              <p class="highlight m-0"><b>CUSTOMER SUPPORT CORRESPONDENCE</b></p>

We will also store the correspondence and any information contained within.</p>
              <p class="highlight m-0"><b>PUSH NOTIFICATIONS &amp; LOCAL NOTIFICATIONS</b></p>
              <p>With your consent, we may send push notifications to your mobile device to provide game updates and other relevant messages. You can manage push notifications from the &ldquo;options&rdquo; or &ldquo;settings&rdquo; page within the relevant game. You may also be able to manage them from your device&rsquo;s settings page for the relevant game.</p>
              <p>We may send local notifications to your mobile device to provide game updates and other relevant information. You can manage local notifications from the &ldquo;options&rdquo; or &ldquo;settings&rdquo; page within the relevant game.</p>
              <p class="highlight m-0"><b>HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</b></p>
              <p>We may collect information about you in any one or more of the following ways:</p>
              <p class="highlight m-0"><b>INFORMATION ABOUT PLAYERS AND PLAY</b></p>
              <p>When you play any of our games, Funcell Games collects and store certain information that you provide directly, through the SNS, direct registration or from other third party website that is offering our game(s). To provide a richer game play and social experience, We also collect information about your play and interaction with other players and the Service. Such information is collected and stored through the use of Log Files.</p>
              <p class="highlight m-0"><b>HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b></p>

            <ul class="policypoints">
              <li>In general, We collect, store and use your information to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. For example, We may use information collected from you in any one or more of the following ways:</li>
              <li>To provide the technical support and respond to user inquiries</li>
              <li>To prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Service</li>
              <li>To notify users for in-game updates</li>
              <li>To provide in-game leaderboards and promote in-game player achievements</li>
              <li>To solicit input and feedback to improve Funcell Games products and services and customize your user experience</li>
            </ul>
              <p>One important use of such information is for better communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to Funcell Games, We&rsquo;ll use it to respond to (i) customer support inquiries, and (ii) keep you informed of your in-game activity, including comments from friends, notifications about in-game status, as well as notifications of gift and game requests. Messages, such as invites to friends to join you in a game, may include your name and profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages directly or in partnership with parties other than Funcell Games. Each Promotional Communication will generally offer recipients various choices about receiving additional messages.</p>
              <p class="highlight m-0"><b>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
              <p>We DO NOT share your information with any third parties for any purpose.</p>
              <p class="highlight m-0"><b>SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</b></p>
              <p>Funcell Games implement reasonable security measures to protect the security of your information both online and offline and we are committed to the protection of customer information.</p>
              <p>For user accounts registered directly with Funcell Games, profile information is protected by the password each member uses to access their account. It is important that you protect and maintain the security of your account and that you immediately notify Us if you encounter any unauthorized use of your account. If you forget the password to your Funcell Games account, the game/app allows you to send a request to receive instructions that explain how to reset your password.</p>
              <p>While We take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of our websites and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure, and We cannot guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe (including your account password), and to log out of your account after use. If your SNS account is hacked, this may lead to unauthorized play of your Funcell Games games, so we request you to keep your account information secure. If you have questions about the security of our websites, please contact Us at contact@funcellgames.in.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure. Although We strive to protect your personal data, We cannot guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our site; any such transmission is at your own risk. Once We have received your information, We have procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
              <p class="highlight m-0"><b>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</b></p>
              <p>If we decide to make material changes to our Privacy Policy, We will notify you and other users by placing a notice on clkproductions.com or by sending you a notice to the e-mail address which We have on file. We may supplement this process by placing notices in our games and on other Funcell Games websites. You can periodically check www.funcellgames.com and this privacy page for updates.</p>
